 Sudoku solver algorithm made by me

In order to solve a sudoku you need to input it as a 2D table to the constructor in the form of [row1,row2...row9], where "rowX" is another list with numbers and "" for empty spaces.

If you want to use the examples run the examples script from any of the two folders.
